    <h2>Show</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I usually don't want too many shows anymore, HOWEVER, I quite enjoy
      watching a series on NETFLIX, called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy_of_Souls" target="_blank">
        Alchemy of Souls</a
      >. My all time favourite from the show is the character named Seo Yul
      because he is so very good looking by my standards as well as many other
      peoples standards. The one circled in red ink is Seo Yul. I hope you learn
      to appreciate him the way I do. The reason for this show being my
      favourite is because the plot is very exciting, exhilarating, and super
      amazing!

    <h2>Idol</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The idol in the image shown below is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Min-hyun" target="_blank"
        >Hwang Min-Hyun</a
      >
      from the Kpop group, NU'EST. He is also the man that plays Seo Yul in the
      show Alchemy of Souls. The band has already disbanded, but I still listen
      to their music.

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I listen to a lot of different music genres, one of them being pop. I've
      always been into kpop, but recently I discovered many old and new groups.
      Some of the groups I like are:
      <ul>
        <li>Stray Kids</li>
        <li>NU'EST</li>
        <li>TWICE</li>
        <li>BTS</li>
        <li>TXT</li>
      </ul> 
      I also quite enjoy listening to Ricky Montgomery, and the song
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyXy0m-4bvE" target="_blank"
        >FACE</a
      > by NU'EST
      very very much.
